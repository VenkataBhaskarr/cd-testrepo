## This is a sample repository that demonstrates the continuos deployement magic through github actions

### Create a simple nodejs server and push it to github

### create an aws ec2 instance and clone the server into the machine and run it there locally 
    - git <something>
    - npm install
    - pm2 kill
    - pm2 start index.js

### from now every time you push changes to your github you have to follow these steps manally in order to bring the latest changes into action.

### one step is to create a deploy.sh file and store all the commands its called shell scripting and you just have to run the .sh file so that it will decerease some of the manual tasks but still there is an issue

### now we will see github actions
